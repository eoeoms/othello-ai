# Othello AI
This project implements "holes" (i.e. locked squares) to the classic board game [Othello](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Othello), while keeping all the AI features from the original project. Every time a new game is created, the user can place holes on the board by clicking any empty squares. After placing down all the holes, the user can click the Start button to begin playing.
